# The Pomodoro App

1) Pomodoro is a technique which we can use to increase one's productivity.
2) It says that work for 25 minutes and with full attention and focus, and after
   25 minutes of hard work ,reward yourself with 5 minutes of break time.
3) After 4 pomodoro sessions you can take a log break of 15 minutes.
4) Do anything for these 5/15 minutes which you might enjoy and then come to work for
   another session.
5) This not only increases your productivity but also refreshes you for the next
   for every time you finish your task.
